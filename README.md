## Description
This is my personal report page in the course MVC at BTH (Blekinge Institute of Technology) in Sweden. The course focuses on object-oriented coding in PHP and building web applications using the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern. Throughout the course, we have worked with the Symfony framework, leveraging the Doctrine ORM for efficient database integration, and learned about modern PHP practices to maintain clean and scalable code. By documenting my development process, challenges encountered, and solutions implemented, this personal report page serves as a comprehensive reflection of my work in this course.

## Project
To test the learned concepts, I have chosen to create a text-based adventure game in Symfony as the final project. The core game logic is implemented using PHP, following the MVC pattern. It incorporates the key principles and techniques covered in the course, including object-oriented coding, database management with Doctrine ORM, and adhering to best practices for maintaining a clean and scalable codebase.

## How to clone the repository and run the application

### Quick guide to cloning the repository
1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository and click **Code**

2. Copy the URL (e.g. HTTPS)

3. In your terminal, go the the directory where you want the cloned repository

4. Run `git clone` followed by the URL you copied:
`git clone <repository-url>`

5. Now you should have a local clone

[Cloning a Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

### Quick guide to running the application
Before attempting to set up and run the application, make sure you have **PHP 8.1 or higher** and **Composer** installed.

You can now install the dependencies with Composer, assuming you have a local clone of the project (see previous section).

1. Go to the project directory and run `composer install`
```
cd <project-directory>/
composer install
```
